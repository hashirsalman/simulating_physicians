High Scoring Example:
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):
- Positive anti-ds DNA antibodies present.
- Fatigue, weight loss, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP).
- Pain and swelling in the right hand (possible inflammatory arthritis).
- Petechial rash on the shins, which may suggest vasculitis or lupus-related rash.
- Family history of autoimmune diseases (father with RA).
Vasculitis:
- The presence of fever, weight loss, and rash points to possible systemic vasculitis, and proteinuria may suggest kidney involvement (seen in conditions like polyarteritis nodosa).
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):
- Swelling and tenderness in the right hand and history of autoimmune disease in the family are consistent with RA.
Peripheral Vascular Disease:
- Bilateral leg pain that worsens with activity but improves with rest
Score: 6/6

Low Scoring Example:
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):
- Swelling and tenderness in the right hand are suggestive of RA. However, no morning stiffness or joint deformities are noted, and fever and weight loss are uncommon for RA.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):
- Fatigue, fever, rash, and proteinuria suggest SLE. However, the absence of a butterfly rash or classic renal symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely. 


Osteoarthritis:
- This is unlikely because the patient has systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss, and the swelling and tenderness are more suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis rather than osteoarthritis.

High Scoring Example:
Amyloidosis:
- Progressive fatigue, weight loss, peripheral edema, and frothy urine (suggesting nephrotic syndrome).
- Tingling sensations in the hands (neuropathy).
- Elevated serum free light chains and positive biopsy for amyloid deposits.
- Mild hepatomegaly and concentric LVH on echo, consistent with cardiac amyloidosis.
Congestive Cardiac Failure:
- Elevated BNP and concentric LVH are typical of Congestive Cardiac Failure. However, the nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria point more to amyloidosis as the cause of heart failure.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):
- Proteinuria and elevated creatinine suggest renal involvement, but the biopsy finding of amyloid deposits confirms the renal involvement is secondary to amyloidosis.
Multiple myeloma

Low Scoring Example:
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):
- Swelling and tenderness along the
femoral veins are suggestive of DVT.
However, the thrombocytopenia and
Heparin exposure suggests a different cause.


Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
(HIT):
- Thrombocytopenia, recent heparin
use, and positive Heparin-PF4 antibody
test support HIT, but the absence of
significant symptoms like fever or
petechiae makes this diagnosis less likely.

Congestive Cardiac Failure:
- While elevated BNP and concentric LVH are present, proteinuria and serum free light chains do not support Congestive Cardiac Failure.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):
- CKD would not explain the neuropathy, fatigue, or weight loss, and the positive biopsy for amyloid confirms amyloidosis rather than CKD as the underlying cause.
Amyloid deposition on biopsy Multiple myeloma:
- Amyloid deposition on biopsy.

Low Scoring Example:
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):

- Hirsutism and acne are present, which
are commonly seen in PCOS.
- The patient's irregular periods and
fatigue also supports PCOS.

Cushing's Syndrome:
- Elevated cortisol could point to
Cushing's Syndrome, but the ACTH
suppression is not explained in the
context of Cushing's Syndrome.

Hypothyroidism:
- The patient is fatigued, has weight
gain, and dry skin, which could indicate
hypothyroidism, but the absence of
bradycardia, cold intolerance, and
elevated TSH makes this unlikely.

High Scoring Example:
Myasthenia Gravis (MG):
Symptoms: Progressive muscle weakness, ptosis, difficulty swallowing, and speech problems.
Pattern: Symptoms worsen at the end of the day and improve with rest, classic for MG (fatigability).
Lab Results: Positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which are diagnostic of MG.
Electromyography (EMG): Decremental response to repeated stimulation is a hallmark of MG.
Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):
Symptoms: Muscle weakness, but typically more prominent in the proximal limbs (not as much in the neck or bulbar muscles).
Pattern: Weakness may improve with activity (different from MG, where weakness worsens with activity).
Lab Results: Negative acetylcholine receptor antibodies, but testing for antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (often positive in LEMS) would be needed.
Electromyography (EMG): LEMS typically shows a facilitation response to repeated stimulation, not a decremental one.
Hypothyroid Myopathy:
Symptoms: Muscle weakness and fatigue can occur in hypothyroidism, but ptosis and bulbar involvement are less common.
History: The patient has hypothyroidism and has been on levothyroxine, though this does not explain the full constellation of symptoms.
Lab Results: No significant abnormalities in thyroid function are reported, so this is less likely.
Electromyography (EMG): Normal CK levels and lack of decremental response suggest this is an unlikely cause.

High Scoring Example:
Myasthenia Gravis:
No opposing findings. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, decremental response on EMG, and the symptom profile strongly support this diagnosis.
Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome:
Opposing findings: Ptosis and bulbar involvement (difficulty swallowing, choking episodes) are more suggestive of MG than LEMS, which typically has a more pronounced proximal limb weakness. The lack of facilitation on EMG also goes against LEMS.
Hypothyroid Myopathy:
Opposing findings: The patient has no thyroid dysfunction on current treatment (levothyroxine). The presence of ptosis and bulbar symptoms points more toward a neuromuscular junction disorder like MG rather than a metabolic cause of myopathy.

High Scoring Example:
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: 
- Acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath after emotional stress (heated argument with son). 
- ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4 and apical ballooning on echo, with preserved basal contraction. 
- Normal coronary angiography (no significant stenosis), which rules out MI.
Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): 
- Elevated troponin and ST-segment elevation are consistent with MI. 
Unstable Angina: 
- Chest pain and elevated troponin are suggestive of unstable angina
Score: 6/6","Total: 6 marks.
(2 points each)

High Scoring Example:
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: 
- No opposing findings; all findings (stress-triggered chest pain, ST elevation, apical ballooning, normal coronary angiography) support Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 
Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): 
- Normal coronary angiography and the absence of significant stenosis rule out MI, as atherosclerotic disease would typically cause coronary obstruction.
Unstable Angina: 
- Normal coronary angiography rules out unstable angina, which is typically associated with coronary artery disease.
- Absence of breathlessness at rest
- Presence of ST elevation on ECG

High Scoring Example:
Acute Coronary Syndrome (Anterior STEMI)
Rationale: The localized ST-elevation in V2-V4, classic ischemic pain radiation, troponin elevation, and hemodynamic changes (tachycardia/hypertension) overwhelmingly support STEMI. Emotional stress is a recognized trigger for plaque rupture. While Takotsubo is plausible, the ECG localization and absence of prior Takotsubo history make STEMI the priority diagnosis requiring immediate intervention.
While Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a very strong differential and may ultimately be the final diagnosis after complete workup, the initial presentation with ST-segment elevation on the ECG mandates that the patient be treated for a STEMI. The immediate goal is to address the life-threatening possibility of a coronary artery occlusion. The axiom ""time is muscle"" applies, and any delay in treating a potential STEMI to consider other diagnoses could lead to irreversible heart muscle damage or death. The definitive differentiation between STEMI and Takotsubo will occur in the cardiac catheterization lab.

Score: 3/3

","Total: 6 marks.
(2 points each)

High Scoring Example:
Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): 
- Crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm. 
- Nausea, sweating, and fatigue are typical symptoms. 
- ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. 
- Elevated troponin supports myocardial injury. 
- The patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are strong risk factors for coronary artery disease. 
Unstable Angina: 
- Chest pain and risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking) are suggestive, but the ST-segment elevation and troponin elevation are more indicative of MI rather than unstable angina. 
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): 
- Chest pain can occur with GERD, but radiation to the left arm, nausea, sweating, and positive ECG findings make this diagnosis unlikely.
Score: 6/6","Total: 6 marks.
(2 points each)

High Scoring Example:
Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): 
- No opposing findings. The clinical presentation, ECG, and elevated troponin are all consistent with MI. 
Unstable Angina: 
- The ST-segment elevation and troponin elevation argue against unstable angina, which would typically show no ST-segment changes and only mild troponin elevation. 
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): 
- The ST-segment elevation and troponin elevation are inconsistent with GERD, which would not cause such findings.
Score: 6/6","Total: 2 marks.

","Total: 6 marks.
(2 points each)

High Scoring Example:
Pulmonary Embolism (PE): 
- Recent hip replacement surgery (2 weeks ago), immobilization, and elevated D-dimer all increase the risk for PE. 
- Sudden onset of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain (sharp, worse with deep breathing/coughing), and tachypnea are classic signs of PE. 
- Chest CT angiogram confirming acute pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. 
Pneumonia: 
- Cough and pleuritic chest pain can be seen in pneumonia. However, the absence of fever, crackles, or wheezing, and the normal temperature make pneumonia less likely. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): 
- Swelling in the right lower leg and recent surgery are suggestive of DVT. However, no warmth or redness and the presence of PE on CT angiogram suggest that the embolism is the result of a DVT.

High Scoring Example:
Pulmonary Embolism (PE): 
- No opposing findings; the clinical presentation, D-dimer, and CT findings strongly support PE. 
Pneumonia: 
- The absence of fever and crackles on exam make pneumonia less likely. The presence of tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and elevated D-dimer suggest PE instead. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): 
- No significant redness or warmth on examination and the absence of a prior DVT history make DVT less likely as the primary cause of this patient’s symptoms.

High Scoring Example:
Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD):
- Melena (black, tarry stools) suggests upper GI bleeding. 
- History of heartburn and frequent antacid use suggests acid-related disease. 
- Positive fecal occult blood test and anemia indicate ongoing blood loss. 
Gastritis with Chronic GI Bleeding:
- Chronic use of antacids suggests possible gastritis. 
- Slow, progressive anemia over a month is consistent with chronic bleeding rather than acute hemorrhage. 
- No signs of massive hemorrhage (e.g., hemodynamic instability), making slow upper GI bleeding more likely. 
Gastrointestinal Malignancy:
- Anemia and fecal occult blood positivity raise suspicion. 
- However, no weight loss or abdominal mass on exam makes this less likely.
